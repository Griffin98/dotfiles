[color.color_transfer]
# options for transfering the color distribution from the source to the target image using the mean and standard deviations of the l*a*b* color space.
# this implementation is (loosely) based on the 'color transfer between images' paper by reinhard et al., 2001. matching the histograms between the source and destination faces.

# should components of l*a*b* image be scaled by np.clip before converting back to bgr color space?
# if false then components will be min-max scaled appropriately.
# clipping will keep target image brightness truer to the input.
# scaling will adjust image brightness to avoid washed out portions in the resulting color transfer that can be caused by clipping.
# 
# choose from: true, false
# [default: true]
clip = True

# should color transfer strictly follow methodology layed out in original paper?
# the method does not always produce aesthetically pleasing results.
# if false then l*a*b* components will be scaled using the reciprocal of the scaling factor proposed in the paper. this method seems to produce more consistently aesthetically pleasing results.

[color.manual_balance]
# options for manually altering the balance of colors of the swapped face

# the colorspace to use for adjustment: the three adjustment sliders will effect the image differently depending on which colorspace is selected:
# 	 rgb: red, green, blue. an additive colorspace where colors are obtained by a linear combination of red, green, and blue values. the three channels are correlated by the amount of light hitting the surface. in rgb color space the color information is separated into three channels but the same three channels also encode brightness information.
# 	 hsv: hue, saturation, value. hue - dominant wavelength. saturation - purity / shades of color. value - intensity. best thing is that it uses only one channel to describe color (h), making it very intuitive to specify color.
# 	 lab: lightness, a, b. lightness - intensity. a - color range from green to magenta. b - color range from blue to yellow. the l channel is independent of color information and encodes brightness only. the other two channels encode color.
# 	 ycrcb: y - luminance or luma component obtained from rgb after gamma correction. cr - how far is the red component from luma. cb - how far is the blue component from luma. separates the luminance and chrominance components into different channels.
# 
# choose from: ['rgb', 'hsv', 'lab', 'ycrcb']

# options for sharpening the face after placement

# select an integer between 100 and 500
# [default: 150]
amount = 150

# affects the size of the edges to be enhanced or how wide the edge rims become, so a smaller radius enhances smaller-scale detail.
# radius is set as a percentage of the final frame width and rounded to the nearest pixel. e.g for a 1280 width frame, a 0.6 percenatage will give a radius of 8px.
# higher radius values can cause halos at the edges, a detectable faint light rim around objects. fine detail needs a smaller radius. 
# radius and amount interact; reducing one allows more of the other.
# 
# select a decimal number between 0.1 and 5.0
# [default: 0.3]
radius = 0.3

# [unsharp_mask only] controls the minimal brightness change that will be sharpened or how far apart adjacent tonal values have to be before the filter does anything.
# this lack of action is important to prevent smooth areas from becoming speckled. the threshold setting can be used to sharpen more pronounced edges, while leaving subtler edges untouched. 
# low values should sharpen more because fewer areas are excluded. 
# higher threshold values exclude areas of lower contrast.

# select a decimal number between 1.0 and 10.0
# [default: 5.0]
threshold = 5.0
